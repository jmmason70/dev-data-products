Hello!  This interactive plot will show you the average heights and weights for American women.



```{r women}
summary(women)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(plotly)
data(women)
plot_ly(women, x=~height, y=~weight, mode="markers") %>%
layout(
  title = "Average Heights and Weights for American Women")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
